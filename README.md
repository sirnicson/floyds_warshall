# Recursive Implementation of Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

## Overview

This project implements Floyd-Warshall's algorithm to compute the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a graph. The key objective is to implement the algorithm both recursively and iteratively, and then compare their performance. This repository contains:

- Recursive implementation of Floyd-Warshall (recursive_floyd.py)
- Iterative implementation of Floyd-Warshall (iterative_floyd.py)
- Unittests to verify correctness
- Performance tests to compare efficiency
