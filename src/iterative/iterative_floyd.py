"""
This module has a simple implementation of Floyd's Algorithm
It contains three main functions:
    main -> controls the execution of the script
    print_out_graph -> prints out the graph with nodes and distances
    recursive_floyd_warshall -> computes shortest path

The global variables are:
    NO_PATH = Marker for where there is no path. This is the max value of an integer
    GRAPH = Contains the distances for the graph. Node names are inferred by the position
    of the node, i.e. position  0 0 in the list is node 0
    MAX_LENGTH = The size of the graph
    NO_PATH_MARKER = Holder for no path possible. This is used for the printing function.
